== Description ==

(Deprecated) The Screenr oEmbed allows get the Screenr embed code for any Screenr screencast.

If you have the URL to a Screenr screencast you can use it to get the embed code without copying and pasting anything, you simply provide a Screenr URL to our oEmbed API and in return you'll get the proper embed code.
